RAGE-TAMER neutralizes rage with gratitude. 

I spent my summers at a girls camp in North Carolina. It was paradise.
Paradise status was crafted and maintained with a set of good-sense rules:
1) Don't die. 
2) Be kind. 
3) Have fun. 

The second guideline was implemented by replacing anything nasty/negative with three positive
things. 

Recently, I had an experience of seeing myself as another. I realized that I
harbored some residual anger that I was not aware of. I found it helpful to get
the rage out by naming it, acknowledging it, rejecting it, and replacing it with
more helpful thoughts. 

But a composition book of pure, unmitigated rage would probably hurt anyone who
happened upon it. Thus the RAGE TAMER: a safe space to get the rage out. Rage
text is converted into nonsense, a rage-score, and a color. And gives you a way
to replace the rage with gratitude.
